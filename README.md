# Typing Speed Race - A Multiplayer Challenge

Typing Speed Race is a real-time multiplayer typing game where players compete in custom rooms by typing the same quote. The game tracks each playerâ€™s speed (WPM) and shows live rankings. Features include synchronized quotes, a countdown timer, and a clean UI for focused typing. Future updates will add leaderboards, new game modes, and performance analytics.

## How It Works
```
ðŸŽ® How to Play
1. Enter Player Details
Input your name and a room ID.

Room ID allows multiple players to join the same room.

2. Join or Create a Room
If a room with the ID exists, you join it.

If it doesnâ€™t exist, a new room is created.

3. Wait or Start
Wait for others to join, or play solo.

Click "Start" to begin the game.

Alternatively, start typing â€” this will also start your personal countdown timer.

4. Start Typing!
Each player has their own timer (not linked to others).

The timer counts down (e.g., 60 seconds).

Your WPM is calculated and broadcast in real-time.

5. Real-time Leaderboard
As you and others type, your WPM scores update on the leaderboard.

Compete to see who types fastest!

6. Game Over
When your timer reaches zero:

The input becomes uneditable.

The leaderboard shows final scores.
